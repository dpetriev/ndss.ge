# Prototyping: From Idea to Product

Creating prototypes is a critically important stage of development.

## Advantages of 3D Prototyping

- Rapid prototype creation (from several hours)
- Low cost compared to traditional methods
- Multiple iteration capability
- Functionality testing before production launch

## Workflow

1. Create 3D model
2. Choose technology and material
3. Print prototype
4. Test and refine
5. Final version
