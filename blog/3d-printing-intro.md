# Introduction to 3D Printing

## Core Technologies

3D printing has revolutionized manufacturing. Several key technologies exist:

- **FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)** - layer-by-layer deposition
- **SLA (Stereolithography)** - light-based curing  
- **SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)** - selective laser sintering

## Popular Materials

Material choice depends on application:

1. PLA - eco-friendly, easy to work with
2. ABS - strong, heat resistant
3. PETG - balance of strength and flexibility
4. Nylon - excellent strength
5. Resins - high detail

**Important**: proper choice of technology and material determines project success.
