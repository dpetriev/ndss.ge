# Prototyping

## From Concept to Physical Product

Rapid prototyping services to validate designs, test functionality, and accelerate product development.

## Why Prototype?

### Design Validation
- Test form, fit, and function
- Identify design flaws early
- User testing and feedback
- Investor presentations

### Cost Reduction
- Avoid expensive tooling mistakes
- Iterate quickly and cheaply
- Optimize before production
- Reduce time to market

### Risk Mitigation
- Test manufacturability
- Validate assembly processes
- Check ergonomics
- Prove concept feasibility

## Prototyping Methods

### 3D Printing
- **Speed:** 1-3 days
- **Cost:** Low to medium
- **Materials:** Plastics, resins
- **Best for:** Complex geometries

### CNC Machining
- **Speed:** 3-7 days
- **Cost:** Medium to high
- **Materials:** Metals, plastics
- **Best for:** Production-like parts

### Vacuum Casting
- **Speed:** 5-10 days
- **Cost:** Medium
- **Materials:** Polyurethane resins
- **Best for:** Small batches (10-50 parts)

### Sheet Metal Fabrication
- **Speed:** 5-14 days
- **Cost:** Medium
- **Materials:** Steel, aluminum
- **Best for:** Enclosures, brackets

## Prototyping Stages

### Proof of Concept (PoC)
- Very basic functionality test
- Low fidelity
- 3D printed or handmade
- Quick and cheap

### Looks-Like Prototype
- Visual appearance focus
- Surface finish important
- Non-functional internals
- For marketing and presentations

### Works-Like Prototype
- Functional testing
- Real mechanics/electronics
- May not look final
- Engineering validation

### Engineering Prototype
- Full functionality
- Production-like materials
- Near-final appearance
- Testing and certification

### Pre-Production
- Pilot run (10-100 units)
- Production tooling test
- Quality validation
- Final design freeze
