# Small Batch Production

## Bridge Between Prototype and Mass Production

Cost-effective small batch manufacturing (10-1000 units) without expensive tooling.

## What is Small Batch Production?

Production of limited quantities when:
- Testing market demand
- Seasonal products
- Custom orders
- Replacement parts
- Limited editions
- Pre-production runs

## Production Methods

### Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing)
- **Quantity:** 1-500 units
- **Lead time:** 1-4 weeks
- **Tooling:** None required
- **Best for:** Complex geometries, customization

### Vacuum Casting
- **Quantity:** 10-100 units
- **Lead time:** 2-4 weeks
- **Tooling:** Low-cost silicone molds
- **Best for:** Production-like quality

### CNC Manufacturing
- **Quantity:** 10-500 units
- **Lead time:** 2-6 weeks
- **Tooling:** Minimal
- **Best for:** Metal and high-precision parts

### Sheet Metal Forming
- **Quantity:** 10-1000 units
- **Lead time:** 2-6 weeks
- **Tooling:** Low to medium cost
- **Best for:** Enclosures, brackets

## Advantages

### No Expensive Tooling
- No injection mold costs ($10k-$100k)
- Quick design changes
- Lower upfront investment
- Faster time to market

### Flexibility
- Easy to modify designs
- Multiple versions possible
- Custom units in same batch
- On-demand production

### Quality Testing
- Validate manufacturing process
- Test market response
- Identify improvements
- Refine before mass production

### Cash Flow Management
- Lower initial investment
- Pay as you grow
- Test demand first
- Reduce inventory risk

## When to Use Small Batch

✅ **Good for:**
- Market testing (50-200 units)
- Kickstarter/crowdfunding
- Custom/personalized products
- Seasonal items
- Replacement/spare parts
- Limited editions
- Pre-orders

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- High-volume needs (>1000/month)
- Extreme cost optimization
- Commodity products
- Very tight margins

## Process

### 1. Preparation
- DFM (Design for Manufacturing) review
- Material selection
- Finish specification
- Quality requirements

### 2. Pre-Production
- First article inspection
- Approval before full batch
- Process optimization
- Timeline confirmation

### 3. Production
