# 3D Scanning

## High-Precision Digital Capture

Convert physical objects into accurate 3D models for reverse engineering, quality control, or archival.

## Scanning Technologies

### Structured Light Scanning
- **Accuracy:** Up to 0.05mm
- **Ideal for:** Small to medium objects
- **Applications:** Product design, jewelry
- **Speed:** Fast capture (5-10 minutes)

### Laser Scanning
- **Accuracy:** ±0.1mm
- **Ideal for:** Large objects, industrial parts
- **Applications:** Manufacturing, restoration
- **Range:** Up to 3 meters

### Photogrammetry
- **Accuracy:** 1-5mm
- **Ideal for:** Large scenes, buildings
- **Applications:** Architecture, monuments
- **Cost-effective:** For large areas

## Applications

### Reverse Engineering
- Create CAD from existing parts
- Recreate obsolete components
- Legacy equipment documentation
- Design improvements

### Quality Control
- Compare as-built vs. CAD
- Deformation analysis
- Wear measurement
- First article inspection (FAI)

### Art & Heritage
- Museum artifacts digitization
- Sculpture reproduction
- Historical preservation
- Archive creation

### Human Body Scanning
- Custom prosthetics
- Ergonomic design
- Fashion and costume
- Medical applications

## Workflow

1. **Object Preparation** - Cleaning, positioning
2. **Scanning** - Multiple angles capture
3. **Processing** - Point cloud alignment
4. **Mesh Generation** - Surface reconstruction
5. **Refinement** - Hole filling, smoothing
6. **CAD Conversion** - Parametric modeling (if needed)

## Deliverables

### File Formats
- **Point Cloud:** .xyz, .pts, .e57
- **Mesh:** .stl, .obj, .ply
- **CAD:** .step, .stp, .iges
- **Inspection:** Color deviation maps

### Data Quality
- Resolution: 0.05mm - 2mm
- Accuracy: ±0.05mm - ±2mm
- Polygon count: Optimized for use
- Texture: RGB color capture
